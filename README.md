This is my personal site.

For now, it should be simple.

I would like to summarize all interesting things I think about and research.

Envisioned structure:
/my-website
    /index.html               # Main landing page
    /projects.html            # Page for side-projects
    /academic.html            # Academic readings and resources
    /business.html            # Business readings and resources
    /about.html               # About your professional background
    /contact.html             # Contact information
    /css
        /style.css            # Stylesheets to keep the design uniform
    /images
        /profile.jpg          # Professional profile image, logos, etc.
        /other-graphics.png   # Other relevant graphics
